# Getting Started with Vue.js and GeoAI

This project demonstrates how to integrate GeoAI with Vue.js for geospatial AI analysis.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm start` or `pnpm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `pnpm build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles Vue in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `pnpm preview`

Locally preview the production build.

### `pnpm lint`

Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.

### `pnpm format`

Formats the code using Prettier.
