## Coming Soon

We're working on examples for additional frameworks:

- **Svelte** - Compile-time optimized framework
- **Solid.js** - Fine-grained reactive framework

## Framework-Agnostic Usage

GeoAI.js is framework-agnostic and can be used with any JavaScript framework or vanilla JS. The core API remains the same across all environments:

```javascript
import { geoai } from "geoai";

const pipeline = await geoai.pipeline(
  [{ task: "building-detection" }],
  mapProviderConfig
);

const result = await pipeline.inference({
  inputs: { polygon: userDrawnPolygon },
  mapSourceParams: { zoomLevel: 18 },
});
```
